Stable tag: 1.4.3

== Description ==

The MailChimp plugin allows you to quickly and easily add a signup form for your MailChimp list as a widget on your WordPress 2.8 or higher site.

Not sure what [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/features/full_list/) is or if it will be helpful? Signup up for a [FREE Trial Account](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup/) and see for yourself!

After Installation, the setup page will guide you through entering your Login information, selecting your List from our Service, selecting options for the Merge Fields and Interest Groups you have setup, and then add the Widget to your site. The time from starting installation to have the form on your site should be less than 5 minutes - absolutely everything can be done via the Wordpress Setting GUI - no file editing at all!

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get started using it.

= Version 2.8+ =
1. Unzip our archive and upload the entire `mailchimp` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings and look for "MailChimp Setup" in the menu
4. Enter your MailChimp API Key and let the plugin verify it.
5. Select One of your lists to have your visitors subscribe to.
6. (optionally) Turn on or off the Monkey Rewards option
7. (optionally) Turn your Merge Vars and Interest Groups `on` and `off`
8. Finally, go to Appearance->Widgets and drag the `MailChimp Widget` widget into one of your Widget Areas
9. And you are DONE!

= Advanced =
If you have a custom coded sidebar or something else special going on where you can't simply enable the widget through the Wordpress GUI, all you need to do is:

If you are using Wordpress v2.8 or higher, you can use the short-code:
` [mailchimpsf_form] `

If you are adding it inside a php code block, pop this in:

` mailchimpSF_signup_form(); `

Or, if you are dropping it in between a bunch of HTML, use this:

`<?php mailchimpSF_signup_form(); ?>`

Where ever you want it to show up.

Note: in some environments you will need to install the Exec_PHP plugin to use that method of display. It can be found here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exec-php/

== Developer Mode ==

You can enable "Devleoper Mode" by adding the following line to your `wp-config.php` file just above the "That's all, stope editing!" line.

    define('MAILCHIMP_DEV_MODE', true);

This will enable the MailChimp List Subscribe plugin to operate without the need to connect an external MailChimp Account, and will provide a
subscription form widget that will not actually submit anywhere.

This will allow you to style and configure the widget in non-production environments that are not publicly accessible.

For more Developer Mode customization options see the following article:

http://connect.mailchimp.com/how-to/how-to-article-configuring-developer-mode-for-the-list-subscribe-wordpress-plugin

== Upgrading ==

If you are upgrading to version 1.2.1 and you used the widget in your sidebar previously, all you need to do is drag the `MailChimp Widget` back into the sidebar, visit the MailChimp settings page (which will have maintained your prior settings), click the "Update List" button, and you're done!
